Compton scattering showed that photons carried momentum by scattering an x-ray source through a slit. Since Einstein proposed the photons carried kinetic energy despite having no mass, the idea that it carried momentum as well is considered ridiculous. 

## Formulas
Photons have kinetic energy.
```ad-formula
#### Kinetic Energy of Photons
#### $$K = \frac{hc}{λ}$$
```

They also have momentum.
```ad-formula
#### Momentum
#### $$p = \frac{h}{λ}$$
```

From these two formulas, the formula for the Compton wavelength can be determined 
```ad-formula
#### Compton Wavelength Formula
#### $$\frac{h}{mc} = 2.4 \times 10^{-12}m$$
```
