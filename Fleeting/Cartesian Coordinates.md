Cartesian coordinates are expressions of physical space using $x$, $y$, and $z$ axes. Physical quantities are expressed as the way they take up space in terms of those 3 axes.

## Formalism
Classical physical quantities like volume $dτ$ can be expressed in terms of their derivatives $dx$, $dy$, and $dz$. They can also be expressed as unit vectors pointing in the respective axes. 
```ad-formula
#### Elements
A line element is a 2-dimensional object.
#### $$d\vec{l} = dx\hat{i} + dy\hat{j} + dz\hat{k} $$
A volume element is a 3-dimensional object.
#### $$dV = dxdydz$$
```


## Relation to Quantum Systems
Quantum quantities are expressed in similar manners.
```ad-formula
#### Expectation Value
The probability of finding a particle in $dτ$ at time $t$ is expressed in terms of the regular [[The Schrödinger Equation|Schrodinger equation]].
#### $$P(x, y, z, t) = |\Psi (x, y, z, t) |^{2} dx\ dy\ dz $$
In addition, the normalization condition of a wavefunction is the same as well.
#### $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dx \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dy \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} dz |Ψ(x, y, z, t)|^{2} = 1 $$
```

```ad-formula
#### Stationary Wavefunction
The wavefunction also has to be represented in terms of all 3 axes.
#### $$Ψ(x, y, z, t) = ψ(x, y, z)e^{-\frac{iEt}{\hbar}}$$
```
