## The List
- Through diffraction of X-ray through polycrystalline samples, we find the electrons have wavelength. 
- Protons that are shot through atomic nuclei form diffraction patterns
- Neutrons shot through a salt crystal forms diffraction patterns as well
- Helium diffracts when beams of it were shot through an LiF crystal.
