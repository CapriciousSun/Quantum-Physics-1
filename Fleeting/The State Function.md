The state function $Ψ$ is the realizable state a system will be in. All information regarding a system is represented by the state function. The wave function is used to denote the state function at a certain time and position. 

## Born's Postulate
Born's postulate states that a measurement to locate a particle associated with a certain wave function $Ψ(\vec{r}, t)$ will result in a probability $P(\vec{r}, t)$ that the particle will be found around the position $\vec{r}$ and it is equal to $P(\vec{r}, t)dv = Ψ^{*}(\vec{r}, t)$
