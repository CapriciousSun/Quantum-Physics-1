## Formalism
The $θ$ and $φ$ solutions can be combined into a single force. 
#### $$F_{lm}(θ, φ) = Θ_{lm}(θ)Φ_{lm}(φ)$$
and when normalized, it yields the spherical harmonic function, which could describe a whole suite of behaviors within particles. They are particularly useful for multiple expansion of charge. 
#### $$Y_{l}^{m} \equiv \left( \frac{2l + 1}{4π} \right) \frac{(l - m)!}{(l + m)!}Θ_{l}^{m}(\cos(θ))e^{imφ}$$
Since $θ$ and $φ$ are orthonormal to each other, they have an orthonormal relation.
#### $$\int \int Y_{l}^{m} Y_{l'}^{m'} \sin(θ)dθ\ dφ = δ_{ll'}δmm'$$
