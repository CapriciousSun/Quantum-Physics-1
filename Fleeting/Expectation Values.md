## Position
For position, the expectation values are derived with $$\langle x \rangle = \int_{-\frac{L}{2}}^{\frac{L}{2}}Ψ^{*}xΨdx$$
where x is the position of the particle the measurement is done on. 

## Energy
The formula for kinetic energy expectation value is $$\langle T_{n} \rangle = \frac{\langle p_{n}^{2} \rangle}{2m} = \frac{1}{2m}\left( \frac{nπh}{L} \right)^{2}$$The lowest allowed energy state is $n = 1$. So the expectation value of kinetic energy is always greater than zero. And since $\langle T \rangle ^{2} - \langle T^{2} \rangle = 0$, the uncertainty regarding energy is zero.
