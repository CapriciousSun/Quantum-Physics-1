Particles are discrete collections of matter. Everything (aside from gravity) could be defined as a particle moving through space. 

## Wave-Particle Duality
The wave-particle duality is a phenomenon that started with [[Photons|photons]], where light can be seen as both a discrete particle and a continuous wave. There was difficulty in reconciling this dual nature of light until the double slit experiment by Thomas Young and the Compton scattering experiment by Arthur Compton showed that light exists as both a wave and a particle.

## de Broglie Wavelength
Louis DeBroglie theorized that if the wave-particle duality exists for photons, then it could exist for all other small enough particles as well. This is confirmed by George Paget where he showed diffraction of electrons through a slit. Other particles have been shown to have a wavelength as well, from protons to larger atoms like a buckmeister fullerene. The de Broglie wavelength is formulated by 
```ad-formula
#### de Broglie Wavelength
#### $$Î» = \frac{h}{p} = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2mK}}$$
$h$ is Planck's constant, $p$ is the momentum of the particle, $K$ is the spatial frequency of the particle's wavefunction, $m$ is the mass of the particle
