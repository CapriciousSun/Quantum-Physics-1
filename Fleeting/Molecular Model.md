The [[The Dirac Delta Function|Dirac Delta function]] can be used to model an electron bound to a proton. 

## Formulation
The formula for this is 
#### $$\frac{2m}{\hbar^{2}}V(x) = -\frac{λ}{a}[δ(x - a) + δ(x + a)]$$
which models the attractive potential between the electron and proton. 
#### $$\frac{p^{2}}{2m} \propto \frac{\partial π^{2}}{\partial }$$
Since $E - V$ is true for everywhere but the two points between $a$ and $-a$, the wavefunction should be normalizable as it conserves probability. So the solution would be in the form of 
#### $$ψ(x) = \begin{cases}
Ce^{kx} \text{ for } x < -a \\
Ae^{kx} + Be^{-kx} \text{ for } -a < x < a \\
De^{-kx} \text{ for } a < x
\end{cases}$$
The method for solving this is similar to solving for [[Piecewise Potential|piecewise potential]], where the strength of the Delta function sis solved with hyperbolic sinusoidal functions. 
#### $$-KA\cosh(Ka) - A\sinh(Ka) = -\frac{λ}{a}A\cosh(Ka)$$
and by dividng $A\cosh(Ka)$
#### $$\tanh(Ka) = \frac{λ}{a} - 1$$
There is another solution to molecular bonding called the antibonding state, and it is of a higher energy state.
