The probability current is a concept used in thinking about traveling particles. At every point across the wave, there's a different probability current based on the slice it's taking out of the wave. 

## The Formula
```ad-formula
#### Probability Current Density
#### $$-\frac{i\hbar}{2m}\left(Ψ^{*}\frac{δΨ}{δx} - Ψ\frac{δΨ^{*}}{δx}\right) \equiv j_{x}(x)$$
```
The final form of this equation is $|A|^{2}v_{0}$. where A is the amplitude of the wave at a specific point and $v_{0}$ is the velocity of the wave. 
```ad-formula
#### Evaluate the probability current for the wave function $Ψ = Ae^{ikx + iωt} + Be^{-ikx + iωt}$
$$j_{x}(x) = -\frac{i\hbar}{2m}(A^{*}e^{-ikx} + B^{*}e^{ikx})(ikAe^{ikx} - ikBe^{-ikx})$$
$$-\frac{i\hbar}{2m}(ikA^{*}A - ikA^{*}Be^{-2ikx} + ikB^{*}Ae^{2ikx} - B^{*}Bik)$$
$$\frac{\hbar k}{2m}$$
```

## Physical Meaning
The probability current is a reflection of the probability of finding a wave traveling in one direction. When the probability current is 0, that means the wave is likely a standing wave, since the measurement for either direction cancels out.
