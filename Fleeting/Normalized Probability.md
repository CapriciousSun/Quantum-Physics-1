The probability of a specific outcome over the total number of experiments it the normal probability. The total possible outcomes is, as a result, 1. It should be noted that average, mean, and expectation values are the same concept. 

## Ensemble Averages
The ensemble average is the probability for a set of outcomes. It is expressed as the sum of all probabilities over. Another statistic is the variance, also called the dispersion, which is square of the standard deviation. 

## Probability Density
A probability density is the probability of finding a particle within the bounds of integration. This is used to compute the expectation values of a certain wave. In the future, this will be represented with density operators.
