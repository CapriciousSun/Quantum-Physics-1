When a light is shone onto a photocathode, a piece of metal, if the light has an appropriate wavelength, the electrons would be ejected from the photocathode. The probability is around 20% of electrons per photon. When a potential is applied, the kinetic energy of the electron ejected could be measured. 

## Stopping Potential
When intensity is doubled, the stopping potential remains the same, and that's known as the stopping point. The stopping point is proportional the the frequency of the light. In other words, the stopping potential increases as the kinetic energy of the photons increase. 

## Formal Definition
```ad-formula
#### The Photoelectric Effect Formula
#### $$eV_{\text{stop}} = hv - Φ_{\text{material}} = E_{\text{photon}} - Φ_{\text{material}}$$
```

## Millikan's 1916 Paper
The photoelectric effect that Einstein postulated was not accepted in 1905 until Robert A. Millikan showed in his 1916 paper that establishes a few axioms. 
1. There is some frequency v, that once above a certain value, causes the maximum ejection of the electrons
2. There is a linear relationship between voltage and frequency
3. The derivative of the slope on voltage and frequency line is equal to $\frac{h}{e}$
4. The critical frequency $v_{0}$ at which $v = 0$, $p = hv_{0}$ is where the lowest frequency on the voltage-frequency line.
5. The contact E.M.F. between any two conductors is given by the equation $\text{E.M.F} = \frac{h}{e}$
