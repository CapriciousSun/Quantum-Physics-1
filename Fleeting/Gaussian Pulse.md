A Gaussian pulse is a localized pulse, whose position is known to a certain degree of accuracy expressed by $Δx = 2σ_{x}$.

## Integration
The unintegrated form of the Gaussian function is 
```ad-formula
#### Gaussian Function
Unintegrated Form
#### $$f(x) = \frac{1}{σ_{x}\sqrt{2π}}e^{\frac{-x^{2}}{2σ_{x}^{2}}}$$
```
