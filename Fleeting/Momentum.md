## Momentum Operators
Expectation value can be derived in terms of the momentum basis. The notation is $\langle p \rangle$ and the measurement method is the same as position $$\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Φ^{*}(p)pΦ(p) \, dx $$
whereas the uncertainty of the momentum is also $\langle p^{2} \rangle$. 

## Amplitude
For a general form of a wave packet with a momentum defined as $$Ψ(x, t) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2π }}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} A(k)e^{i(kx - ωt)} \, dk $$
the amplitude can be derived as $$A(k) = \frac{1}{\sqrt{ 2π }}\int_{-\infty}^{\infty} Ψ(x, 0)e^{-ikx} \, dx $$
