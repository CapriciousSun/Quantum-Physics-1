The idea behind the Heisenberg Uncertainty Principle is that there is no way to know the position and momentum of a particle at the same time to the same level of accuracy. This is the result of the particle changing once its been observed. Since all objects have wavelength, this principle hence applies to all objects. 

## Relation to the Gaussian pulse
By converting the standard form of a [[Gaussian Pulse|Gaussian]], the result for a Gaussian pulse is $σ_{x}σ_{k} = 1$. For anything other than a Gaussian pulse, it'll be greater than 1.
