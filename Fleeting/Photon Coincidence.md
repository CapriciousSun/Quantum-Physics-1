There was some doubt as to if photons truly existed, so experiments were ran in order to experimentally verify the existence of photons and not the result of waves.

## Experimental Procedure
They would excite a calcium atom, and the electron would get excited. A detector would be in charge of detecting the two separate beams of light, green and violet. The intensity is set so that the system observes on event at a time. The idea is that if photons exists, which mean they are indivisible, the photon would go through the beam splitter to arrive at one singular quanta, and not both detectors. 

## Results
What is found is that indeed, the detected events are only either in one or the other, which provides evidence the photons are indivisible quanta.
